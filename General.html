					<div class="s-body"><!--TYPO3SEARCH_begin--><a id="c1112"></a><p>The TYPO3 project was founded by Kasper  Skårhøj and has attracted many people to join the community ever since. The  vision of our project is &quot;Inspiring people to share&quot;. This motto is  central to the way the TYPO3 community collaborates. Members of the  TYPO3 community need to work together effectively, and this code of  conduct lays down the &quot;ground rules&quot; for our cooperation.
</p>
<p>Our motto  perfectly captures the spirit of the sharing and cooperation that is at  the heart of the open source movement. In the Free Software world, we  collaborate freely on a volunteer basis to build software for everyone's  benefit. We improve on the work of others, which we have been given  freely, and then share our improvements on the same basis.
</p>
<p>That  collaboration depends on good relationships between developers. To this  end, we've agreed on the following code of conduct to help define the  ways that we think collaboration and cooperation should work.</p><a id="c1113"></a><h2>Community Ground Rules</h2><p class="bodytext">This Code of Conduct covers your behaviour as a  member of the TYPO3 Community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence. The TYPO3  Association will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member  of the community.  </p><a id="c1419"></a><div class="accordion "><a id="#c1420"></a><h5 class="a-h open"><span>Be considerate.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1424"></a><p><strong>Be 	considerate.</strong>  Your 	work will be used by other  people, and you in turn will depend on  	the work of others. Any  decision you make will affect users and 	 colleagues, and we expect you  to take those consequences into 	account  when making decisions.</p></div></div><a id="#c1422"></a><h5 class="a-h"><span>Be respectful.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1427"></a><p><strong>Be 	respectful.</strong>  The TYPO3 	community and its members  treat one another with respect.  Everyone 	can make a valuable  contribution to the  TYPO3 project. We may  not 	always agree, but  disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and  	poor manners. We  might all experience some frustration now and then, 	 but we cannot  allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. 	 It's important  to remember that a community where people feel 	 uncomfortable or  threatened is not a productive one. We expect 	members  of the TYPO3  community to be respectful when dealing with 	other  contributors as  well as with people outside the TYPO3 project and users of  TYPO3.  	</p></div></div><a id="#c1421"></a><h5 class="a-h"><span>Be collaborative.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1428"></a><p><strong>Be 	collaborative.</strong>  The 	TYPO3 project and Free  Software are about collaboration and  working 	together. Collaboration  reduces redundancy of work done in the  Free 	Software world, and  improves the quality of the software produced.  	You should aim to  collaborate with other TYPO3 maintainers, as well 	 as with the upstream  community that is interested in the work you 	do.  Your work should be  done transparently and patches from TYPO3 	should be  given back to the  community when they are made, not just 	when the  distribution releases.  If you wish to work on new code for 	existing  upstream projects, at  least keep those projects informed of 	your ideas  and progress. It may  not be possible to get consensus 	from upstream or  even from your  colleagues about the correct 	implementation of an idea,  so don't feel  obliged to have that 	agreement before you begin, but at  least keep the  outside world 	informed of your work, and publish your  work in a way  that allows 	outsiders to test, discuss and contribute to  your efforts.   	</p></div></div><a id="#c1423"></a><h5 class="a-h"><span>When you disagree, consult others.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1429"></a><p><strong>When 	you disagree, consult others.</strong>  	Disagreements,  both political and technical, happen all the time and 	 the TYPO3  community is no exception. The important goal is not to 	avoid   disagreements or differing views but to resolve them 	constructively.   You should turn to the community and to the 	community process to seek   advice and to resolve disagreements. We 	have the TYPO3 Association which&nbsp;will help to decide the right course 	for the TYPO3 project. There are   also several Project Teams and Team 	Leaders, who may be able to help   you figure out which direction will 	be most acceptable. If you really   want to go a different way, then 	we encourage you to make a derivative   distribution or alternative 	set of packages available using the TYPO3   Package Management 	framework, so that the community can try out your   changes and ideas 	for itself and contribute to the discussion.  	</p></div></div><a id="#c1425"></a><h5 class="a-h"><span>When you are unsure, ask for help.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1430"></a><p><strong>When 	you are unsure, ask for help.</strong>  	Nobody knows  everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the 	 TYPO3  community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the 	road,  and so  questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be 	 responsive  and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must 	be  taken to do  so in an appropriate forum. Off-topic questions, such 	as  requests for  help on a development mailing list, detract from 	 productive  discussion.  	</p></div></div><a id="#c1426"></a><h5 class="a-h"><span>Step down considerately.</span></h5><div class="a-body"><div class="a-content"><a id="c1431"></a><p><strong>Step 	down considerately.</strong>  	Developers on every project  come and go and the TYPO3 project is no 	 different. When you leave or  disengage from the project, in whole or 	in  part, we ask that you do so  in a way that minimises disruption to 	the  project. This means you  should tell people you are leaving and 	take the  proper steps to ensure  that others can pick up where you 	leave off.</p></div></div></div><a id="c1114"></a><h2>Mailing Lists and Web Forums</h2><p>Mailing lists and web forums are an important  part of the TYPO3 community platform. This code of conduct applies very  much to your behaviour in those forums too. Please follow these  guidelines in addition to the general code of conduct:</p><ul><li>Please 	use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.</li><li>Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.  On matters of community governance, the TYPO3 Association can make a final decision.</li></ul><a id="c1417"></a><h2>Sharing</h2><p>The TYPO3 Code Of Conduct is based on the Ubuntu Code Of Conduct.
